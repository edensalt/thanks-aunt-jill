# thanks-aunt-jill

Whether you just got married or wrapped up the holiday season, it can be overwhelming to send dozens of thank you cards for your gifts.

Thanks Aunt Jill has you covered, creating a one-stop shop to keep track of your thank you cards, and giving you a little boost to help write them, too!

Once you add a gift to your list, Thanks Aunt Jill generates a thoughtful thank you letter, powered by OpenAI. Your dashboard keeps track of thank you cards you need to send, so you'll never forget to share your gratitude. Once sent, you can look back on all of the gifts you've received from family and friends.
